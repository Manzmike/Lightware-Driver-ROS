  <p align="center">
    This repo contains a ROS2 driver for the SF30/D (200 m) Lightware LiDAR. This package was ported to ROS2 for use in the CARMA 1tenth scaled-down cooperative driving automation program. The code has been tested in Ubuntu 20.04/ROS2 Foxy.

   ```
2. Navigate to the root directory
   ```sh
   cd lightware_driver
   ```
3. Build the package with colcon
   ```sh
   colcon build --packages-select lightware_driver
   ```
4. Source ROS 2 in the command line
   ```sh
   . install/setup.bash
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use this ROS2 driver for the Lightware SF30/D (200 m) LiDAR, first make sure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies and have built the package using colcon (see Getting Started). Once you have built the package, you can run the driver using the following command:

```sh
ros2 run lightware_driver talker
```
This will start the driver node and begin publishing point cloud data from the LiDAR. You can subscribe to the point cloud topic using another node or visualization tool, such as RViz.

Additionally, you can configure the driver by modifying the parameters in the YAML file located in the params/ directory. For example, you can adjust the maximum range or minimum intensity thresholds, or set the number of points to skip between scans. These parameters can be modified at runtime using the ros2 param command.

For more information on using ROS2 and working with LiDAR data, refer to the ROS2 documentation and LiDAR tutorials.
